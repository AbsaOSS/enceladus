Error Column
============

`errCol` description will come here

### Random notes

Notes not to be forgotten and included when proper documentation is created

* When *Standardization* of a value fails and the column has a `sourcecolumn` *metadata* property defined, the
`sourcecolumn` value, the actual source of the data, will be mentioned in the error. Not the output column name.
