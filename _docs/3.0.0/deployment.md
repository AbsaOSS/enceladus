## Menas

### Prerequisits to deploying Menas are

- Tomcat 8.5+ to deploy the war to
- `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` environment variable. This variable should point to a folder containing Hadoop configuration files (`core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml` and `yarn-site.xml`). These are used to query the HDFS for folder locations.
- MongoDB 4.0+ used as a storage
- _OPTIONAL_ [Spline 0.3.X](https://absaoss.github.io/spline/0.3.html) for viewing of the lineage from Menas. Even without Spline in Menas, Standardization and Conformance will log lineage to Mongo.

### Deploying Menas

The easiest way to deploy Menas is to copy the `menas-VERSION.war` to `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps`. This will create `<tomcat IP>/menas-VERSION` path on your local server.
