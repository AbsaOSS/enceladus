/**
  * Class bundling together switched for features to be used during Conformance
  * It's a sealed abstract case class to enforce the the provided constructor (apply). This way values can be
  * changed only via the setters. This way enforces setting them by name only instead of by position like it would be in
  * the case of classical constructor.
  *
  * @param experimentalMappingRuleEnabled If true the new explode-optimized conformance mapping rule interpreter will be used
  * @param catalystWorkaroundEnabled      If true the Catalyst optimizer workaround is enabled
  * @param controlFrameworkEnabled        If true sets the checkpoints on the dataset upon conforming
  * @param broadcastStrategyMode          Specifies the mode of operation of the broadcasting strategy for mapping rules
  * @param broadcastMaxSizeMb             Specifies the maximum size of a mapping table for which the broadcasting strategy can be used.
