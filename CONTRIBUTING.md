# How to contribute to Enceladus

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug has not already been reported** by searching our **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues)**.
* If you are unable to find an open issue describing the problem, use the **Bug report** template to open a new one. Tag it with the **bug** label.

## **Do you want to request a new feature?**

* **Ensure the feature has not already been requested** by searching our **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues)**.
* If you are unable to find the feature request, create a new one. Tag it with the **request** label.

## **Do you want to implement a new feature or fix a bug?**

* Check logs for the feature/bug. Check if someone isn't already working on it.
  * If the feature/bug is not yet filed, please write it up first:
    * **"Life, the universe and everything"**
* Fork the repository.
* We follow the [**GitFlow**](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching strategy:
  * Cut your branch from develop, add the GitHub Issue in the branch name:
    * **feature/42-life-universe-everything**
    * **bugfix/42-life-universe-everything**
* Code away. Ask away. Work with us.
  * Commit messages should start with a reference to the GitHub Issue and provide a brief description in the imperative mood:
    * **"#42 Answer the ultimate question"**
  * Don't forget to write tests for your work.
* After finishing everything, push to your forked repo and open a Pull Request to our develop branch:
  * Pull Request titles should start with the Github Issue number:
    * **"42 Life, the universe and everything"**
  * Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the solution.

#### Thanks!
