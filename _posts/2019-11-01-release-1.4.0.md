## Menas Improvements
- [#44]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/44) Menas API now uses `DELETE` method for `/disable` calls and `PUT` for `/edit` calls. `POST` calls to `/edit` are deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0.
- [#553]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/553) Schema field selectors (e.g. in conformance rule creation) now have a search bar. Also, improved styling/UX of the local table search.

## Conformance Improvements
- [#748]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/748) Fixed error message shown in cases where a mapping table directory is empty. The message will now make that clear rather than log a misleading exception.

## Other Improvements
- [#984]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/984) Fixed encoding problem when `Standardization` and `Conformance` jobs query legacy entities (v0.x) which have special characters in their names.
- [#1000]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1000) `Standardization` and `Conformance` jobs can now run in a more fault-tolerant way, by specifying multiple `Menas URLs`. This can be done per environment in the `enceladus_env.sh` script.
- [#1001]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1001) Fixed issue with how `Standardization` and `Conformance` handle `4xx` and `5xx` responses from Menas. Error codes due to expired session will now be reauthenticated automatically (as intended) and exceptions will now have a more specific type. 
- [#1003]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1003) The `Menas` `API` and `UI` Run URLs will now be logged correctly for each `Menas` instance on the environment.
