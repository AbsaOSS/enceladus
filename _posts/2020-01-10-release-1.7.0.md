## Menas Improvements
- [#273]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/273) Menas `Runs` are now grouped by dataset name making it easier to navigate to the appropriate `Run`.
- [#1069]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1069) Fixed issue with initialization of enceladus jars for oozie integration when fetching binaries from remote maven repo.
- [#1120]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1120) Disabled entities can now be recreated, as well as viewed by specifying their name in the URL. But they remain unlisted in the navigation menu and search bar.

## Scripts Improvements
- [#1093]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1093) Spark resource defaults are now environment-specific instead of hardcoded. Also, Standardization and Conrocmance now have different Spark resource defaults. The number of executors can now be omitted to use defaults available on a cluster, like dynamic resource allocation, for instance.
- [#1103]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1103) The `Run scripts` now also allow for environment-specific default values to be set for the number of executors for Standardization (`STD_DEFAULT_NUM_EXECUTORS`) and Conformance (`CONF_DEFAULT_NUM_EXECUTORS`)
