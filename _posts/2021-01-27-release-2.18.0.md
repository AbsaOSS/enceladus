## Standardization and Conformance Improvements

- [#1239]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1239) Input paths for each job gets validated
- [#1579]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1579) Parameters processing is run first, so running help would be faster

## Conformance Improvements

- [#1467]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1467) It's now possible to filter mapping tables. This makes them smaller, therefore more effective for join, allowing broadcasting. It also eliminates the need to create `lit` columns for desired mapping joins.

## Menas Improvements

- [#1569]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1569) Dataset properties (per dataset) and property definitions (system-wide) support has been added (pilot phase), it is REST managed without UI for now.
- [#1570]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1570) Properties now can be added to dataset on create, edit or import. They are expected as an object of key-value pairs. Export function exports them as the same.
