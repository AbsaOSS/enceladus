# Menas Improvements

- [#1844]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1844) When saving a dataset with undefined recommended property a warning dialog is shown.
- [#1842]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1842) Dataset properties editing UX has been enhanced - now, there is more room for the property name, a useful tooltip is provided and the dialog is resizable (Small by default).

## Standardization and Conformance Improvements

- [#1819]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1819) When a recommended or mandatory but allowed for run property is missing, the `spark-jobs` logs a warning.

## Standardization Fixes

- [#1836]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1836) Time zone in metadata is taken into account even if the source data is already of timestamp type.

## Menas Fixes

- [#1820]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1820) Now Audit Trail in Menas shows added, removed and changed properties
- [#1821]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1821) Fixed: Dataset properties checking broke some Conformance Rules updates.
