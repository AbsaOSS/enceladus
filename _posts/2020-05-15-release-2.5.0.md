## Standardization & Conformance Improvements

- [#1294]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1294) **Record ID generation:** `enceladus_record_id` column is added in Enceladus (Standardization/Conformance) if it does not exist. By default it contains UUID for each record, but the implementation is overridable with `-Denceladus.recordId.generation.strategy={uuid|stableHashId|none}` 
- [#1322]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1322) [**\_INFO file validation:**](/docs/2.0.0/usage/info-file#validation) Added `control.info.validation` configuration option for \_INFO file validation which can have the following values: `strict` will fail the job on failed validation, `warning` will display the error as warning, but will not fail the job and `none` will ignore the result of the validation. Providing an incorrect value will fail the job with a RuntimeException
- [#1317]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1317) [**\_INFO file validation:**](/docs/2.0.0/usage/info-file#validation)  When \_INFO file validation is enabled ([#1322]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1322)), the error will provide a verbose error such as _"Checkpoint validation failed: Missing source checkpoint"_
- [#1329]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1329) Added support of specifying JavaX security properties in `application.conf` instead of passing them via command line as `-D...`. Added support for secure Kafka operation when Spark jobs are running in cluster mode (only client mode was supported until now for secure Kafka). 

### New Configuration options
- [`control.info.validation`](/docs/2.0.0/usage/config#control.info.validation)
- [`enceladus.recordId.generation.strategy`](/docs/2.0.0/usage/config#enceladus.recordId.generation.strategy)
