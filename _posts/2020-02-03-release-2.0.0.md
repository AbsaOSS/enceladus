This major release was focused on restructuring the project, its artifacts, and configurations. 
These are not changes that should affect users but are breaking for the people who deploy the project.

## Breaking Changes
- [#64]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/64) Standardization and Conformance are now combined in one artifact - `spark-jobs.jar`. 
This allows using a single JAR file for both jobs. 
The class names for the jobs remain the same. 
*Note:* This change requires updating helper scripts and setting the `SPARK-JOBS-JAR` environment variable in `enceladus_env.sh`.
- [#1090]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1090) All `Enceladus` modules are now under the same `enceladus` group ID in the `absa.co.za` organization. 
They will no longer have the `enceldus-` prefix and will not appear as top-level artifacts in maven.
- [#1099]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1099) `Menas` properties no longer have the `za.co.absa.encealdus.` prefix. 
See the `application.properties.template` fo details in deploying Menas.

## Conformance Improvements
- [#1078]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1078) Added broadcast strategy for the mapping conformance rule to improve performance
 when a mapping table is small, as well as to support joining array elements of streaming sources to mapping tables. 
- [#1129]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1129) The broadcasting mapping rule strategy can now be used in experimental mode. 
It's only required that this setting be specified: `conformance.mapping.rule.experimental.implementation=true`. 
There are two additional options to control the broadcasting strategy. 
When `conformance.mapping.rule.broadcast=auto`, the strategy will be used for mapping tables smaller than the size defined (in megabytes) 
by `conformance.mapping.rule.max.broadcast.size.mb`.
- [#1136]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1136) Nested array transformations API were extracted into a separate project: [spark-hats](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/spark-hats).
- [#1159]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1159) Fixed the broadcasting mapping rule dropping of standardization errors when trying to conform a null array.

## Standardization Improvements
- [#1101]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1101) Added support for metadata in arrays of simple types (e.g. `pattern` can be specified for array of timestamps).

## Menas Improvements
- [#1118]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1118) Update `Spring Boot` to version `2.2.2`.
- [#1151]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1151) Fixed issue with selecting the `Runs` tile on the landing page not loading the `Runs` in the navigation.
- [#1167]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1167) Fixed bug where interrupted `Runs` in the database cause failure to query `RunSummaries`.

## Other changes
- [#1145]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1145) Removed external modules `fixed-width` and `kafka`.
- [#1147]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1147) Set Copyright year to year of inception.
