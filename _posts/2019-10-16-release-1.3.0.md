## Menas Improvements
- [#884](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/884) New monitoring endpoints added, including a healthcheck endpoint `.../menas/admin/health` (See [Menas documentation for details]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/1.0.0/menas))
- [#935](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/935) Menas environment name is now displayed in the browser's tab.
- [#945](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/945) REST calls to `Menas` creating `Run` objects now validate that `Dataset` name and version are provided.

## Standardization Improvements
- [#398](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/398) Renaming in `Standardization` (using `sourcecolumn` metadata key) is now more robust:
  * Rename does not run the danger of name clashes with other columns anymore.
  * Danger of `ErrorCol` name clash has been removed.
  * Nested column renames are now registered with ATUM.
  * One column can be a source for multiple standardized columns.
- [#887](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/887) The schema metadata key `allowinfinity` now works for `Float` and `Double`. The possible values for the key are `"true"` and `"false"` (Boolean in String format), when not specified `"false"` is considered default. If set to `"true""` it allows the column to be marked as `infinity/-infinity` for values which are too big.

## Scripts Improvements
- [#899](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/899) Run scripts now allow you to control the storage level of dataframe persistence with the `--persist-storage-level` option. This can help fine-tuning `Standardization` and `Conformance` jobs for specific datasets. (See [README for details](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/blob/develop/README.md#run))
- [#922](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/922) Run scripts now allow further spark tuning with these options: `--executor-cores`, `--conf-spark-executor-memoryOverhead`, `--conf-spark-memory-fraction`. (See [README for details](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/blob/develop/README.md#run))
- [#926](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/926) Command line autocompletion is now available for the `Standradization` and `Conformance` run scripts when the `enceladus_autocompletions.sh` script is sourced along with a `$PATH_TO_SCRIPTS` environment variable.
- [#929](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/929) Added validation to run scripts to ensure authentication credentials are provided.
- [#953](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/953) Handling of environment-specific Spark configurations (`ADDITIONAL_SPARK_CONF`) is now done separately from JVM configurations (`ADDITIONAL_JVM_CONF`) in the `enceladus_env.sh` script.

## Model Migration Improvements
- [#912](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/912) Migration CLI tools now have logging enabled.
- [#920](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/920) Fixed issue with Continuous/Incremental Migration process hanging at the end.
- [#921](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/921), [#931](https://github.com/absaoss/enceladus/issues/931) Fixed potential memory issues in the migration framework.

## Other Improvements
- [#492](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/492) Rewrote the DAO module to improve maintainability of `Standardization` and `Conformance`'s communication with `Menas`.
- [#914](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/914) Removed selenium module. It did not reflect current projects state.
- [#941](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/941) `Run` metadata is now added at the beginning of a Spark job so if the job fails users have additional information for debugging. This includes additional Spark configuration parameters of the `Run`.
- [#942](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus/issues/942) At the end of `Standardization` and `Conformance` jobs, the `Menas` URL (for the API and UI) of the concluded run will now be logged.
- [#968](https://github.com/absaoss/enceladus/issues/968) `Standardization` and `Conformance` runs now provide additional metadata about the input and output data sizes. These are similar to input and output directory sizes but do not include hidden files (`_INFO`, `_LINEAGE`, etc)
