<!--more-->

Backported some fixes from [2.22.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/06/06/release-2.22.1.html)

## Menas Fixes

- [#1784]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1784) Dataset property values are now suggested instead of prefilled; suggested values are optional in the system. The optionality of enum-property fields is now fixed.

## Helper Scripts Fixes

- [#1794]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1794) In bash helper scripts `CMD_LINE` was being used before the first initialization and then overwritten so some settings would be ignored in the end. `CMD_LINE` initialization was now moved up in the process so this doesn't happen.
  
## General Project Changes

- [#1790]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/1790) Removed dependencies on discontinued bintray.com repository.
